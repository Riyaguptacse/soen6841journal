Key Concepts Learned:

Peer Interactions:
This week I didnâ€™t interact with my peers much, and I didn't have any collaborative insights from them, but in the class, after the first exercise, I was able to make someone understand what a project charter, project scope, and project objective are and heard from them what their views on them, which makes it more clear for me the objective definition of the project. In the class,i was having an interaction with the professor during the lecture and I noted down the important examples and things the professor was telling.I spent only 3 hours a week to study from book as well as for professor slides but from the next week i will surely increase my time.
Challenges Faced:
I faced moderate challenges in understanding the concepts regarding the cost estimate and effort estimate and finding the relationship between them. I took help from the internet and book to find the relation between the two, and at the moment I might have a clear understanding of this, but I need more in-depth knowledge of this topic as I am still confused between them and got to know one thing: a raw estimate is produced when formula-based methods like COCOMO or FPA are used to obtain the effort and cost estimates, but there are no risk factors mentioned.
